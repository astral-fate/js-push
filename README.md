# js-push


in this exercise, we tests our knowledge which realtes to using function methods:




             pop();
             push(3);
             shit();
             unishift();
             
             
             
 we 1st created an array, which contains of number of elements, then we used our methods to add an item to the array, by using push
 
                       
 
 
                                  const years = [2018, 2019, 2020, 2021];

                                   function arrIs (){
 
 
 
 
 then we deleted an item by using pop()  
 from the begining, we delited the 1st item by using the method unishift 
 
    
                     function removeArray (){

                       years.pop();
                       years.shift();
                       years.shift();
                       years.shift();
                       console.log(years);
     
                         }
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 the output will be as follows:
